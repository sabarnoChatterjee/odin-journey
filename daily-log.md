### Day 1 (Sep 15, 2025)
- Finished Foundations → Lists

- Plan: start Forms next



### Day 2 (Sep 16, 2025)  
- Finished Foundations → Commit Messages (cbea.ms + Conventional Commits)  
- Completed Recipes project with multiple pages, images, and README (credits included)  
- Learned structured commit practices (feat:, docs:, fix:, etc.)  
- Practiced pushing with git push vs git push -u origin main  
- Plan: move on to next Foundations lesson after Recipes
