    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft little pockets of joy made from a simple flour dough, filled with seasoned chicken or vegetables mixed with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and spring onions. Dumplings can be steamed for a delicate, juicy texture, or pan-fried for a crispy bottom with a tender top. They’re versatile, light yet satisfying, and often paired with a tangy dipping sauce.</p>
