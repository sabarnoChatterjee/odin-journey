## ðŸ”‘ Key Points from [cbea.ms/git-commit](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

- Separate **subject** (the first line) from the **body** with a blank line.  
- Keep subject lines **short (~50 characters)** but descriptive.  
- Start subject lines with a **capital letter**.  
- Do not end subject lines with a period.  
- Use the **imperative mood** ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug").  
- The body (if needed) should explain **what** and **why**, not **how**.  
- Wrap the body text at ~72 characters per line for readability in CLI tools.

- **Types** commonly used:
- `feat:` â†’ a new feature
- `fix:` â†’ a bug fix
- `docs:` â†’ documentation only changes
- `style:` â†’ formatting, white-space, missing semicolons (no logic changes)
- `refactor:` â†’ code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test:` â†’ adding or fixing tests
- `chore:` â†’ changes to build process, tools, or configs
- Scopes (optional) provide more context (e.g., `docs(readme): ...`).  
- Encourages **machine-readable commit history** â†’ useful for automation, changelogs, semantic versioning.
