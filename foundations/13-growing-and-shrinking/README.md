# Growing and Shrinking

In this lesson you’ll dig deeper into how flex items size themselves using the `flex` shorthand and its underlying properties.

---

## Key Concepts

- `flex` shorthand = `flex-grow` + `flex-shrink` + `flex-basis` :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **flex-grow** → how much a flex item will grow when there is extra space :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **flex-shrink** → how a flex item will shrink when space is insufficient :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **flex-basis** → the initial size from which growing/shrinking is calculated :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- The default of `flex: 1` is equivalent to `flex: 1 1 0` :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why It’s Useful

- Lets you control how items expand or contract in a container depending on screen size.  
- Helps prevent unexpected shrinking or stretching of items.  
- Makes layouts more predictable when designing responsive interfaces.
