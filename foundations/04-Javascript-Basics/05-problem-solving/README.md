# Problem Solving

This lesson explores the mindset and methodology behind writing programs: breaking down problems, planning solutions, and using pseudocode.

## What You Will Learn

- The three key steps in the problem solving process: **understand → plan → execute**  
- How to use **pseudocode** to translate ideas into algorithms  
- The technique of **divide and conquer** — breaking a larger problem into smaller subproblems  
- Applying structured thinking to examples like **FizzBuzz**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Understand the Problem**  
  Make sure you fully grasp what's being asked. Rewrite it in your own words and clarify inputs, outputs, and constraints.

- **Planning**  
  Instead of jumping into code, sketch out the logic first. Determine inputs, outputs, and sequence of actions. Begin writing in pseudocode.

- **Pseudocode**  
  Write the algorithm in plain language (no strict syntax) to map out logic before coding.

- **Divide and Conquer**  
  Tackle complex problems by solving simpler subproblems one at a time. Often solving one piece reveals the next step.

- **Example — FizzBuzz**  
  A classic programming exercise:
  - Print numbers 1 to N, replacing multiples of 3 with “Fizz,” multiples of 5 with “Buzz,” and multiples of both with “FizzBuzz.”  
  - Use decision logic and loop structures after breaking down the steps.

## Why It Matters

- Problem solving is the core of software development — tools and languages are secondary  
- Using a structured method avoids wasted time and confusion  
- Practice with well-defined exercises builds intuition for bigger projects
