# JavaScript Data Types & Conditionals

## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript values are divided into two categories: primitive types and reference types.

### Primitive Data Types
- **String**: Represents textual data.  
- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.  
- **BigInt**: Represents very large integers beyond the safe integer limit.  
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values, either true or false.  
- **Undefined**: A variable declared but not assigned a value.  
- **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any value.  
- **Symbol**: Unique identifiers, often used as object keys.

### Reference Data Types
- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs.  
- **Array**: An ordered collection of values.  
- **Function**: A callable object used to perform tasks.

## Conditionals in JavaScript

Conditionals control the flow of programs by making decisions based on conditions.

### if Statement
Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.  

### if...else Statement
Provides an alternative block of code if the condition is false.  

### if...else if...else
Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the first true block.  

### switch Statement
Used to perform different actions based on the value of a variable, offering a cleaner alternative to multiple else-if statements.  

### Ternary Operator
A shorthand conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values.

## Key Notes
- JavaScript is loosely typed, allowing variables to change types dynamically.  
- Strings are immutable, meaning once created they cannot be altered, only replaced.  
- Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==) to avoid unexpected results.  
- Conditionals are essential for adding logic and decision-making to programs.
