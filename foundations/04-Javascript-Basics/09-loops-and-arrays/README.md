# Loops & Arrays

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to handle repetition in your code using loops, and how to store and manage collections of data using arrays.

---

## What I Learned

- How to use loops (like `for`, `while`) to repeat tasks without writing duplicate code  
- How arrays act as ordered collections of items  
- How loops and arrays work together to process data  
- Common array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`  
- Introduction to test-driven development (TDD) in context of loops and arrays

## Key Concepts

- **Loops** let you execute the same block of code multiple times efficiently  
- **Arrays** let you group multiple values under one variable  
- You can iterate over array elements using loops  
- Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` provide powerful ways to transform arrays  
- TDD encourages writing tests before or alongside your implementation
