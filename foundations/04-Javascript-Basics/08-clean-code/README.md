# Clean Code

This lesson covers principles and practices that make code readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.

## Key Concepts

- **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand by others (and your future self).  
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive variable, function, class names.  
- **Small functions**: Each function should do one thing and be short.  
- **Consistent formatting**: Use a consistent style (indentation, spacing, braces).  
- **Avoid duplication**: Donâ€™t repeat logic; abstract repeated patterns.  
- **Comment sparingly**: Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.  
- **Single responsibility principle**: Each module/class/function has one responsibility.
