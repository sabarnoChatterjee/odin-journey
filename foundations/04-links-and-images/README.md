# Links and Images

## About
This lesson covers adding hyperlinks and images to a webpage.

## What I Learned
- Difference between **absolute** (full URL) and **relative** (local file) links
- How to link between pages in the same project
- Using the `target="_blank"` attribute to open links in a new tab
- Why we add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"`
  - **noopener** → prevents the new tab from controlling the original page via JavaScript (security)
  - **noreferrer** → hides the referring page URL from the new site (privacy)
- Adding images with `<img>` and descriptive `alt` text
- Creating clickable (linked) images
